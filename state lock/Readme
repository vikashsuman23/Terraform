State locking prevents more than one Terraform command from changing the same state file at the same time.

If state locking is not used:
  Two people can run Terraform together
  The state file can get corrupted
  Infrastructure may break or behave unpredictably

Terraform automatically locks the state whenever it runs commands that modify infrastructure.
You usually won’t see any message when the lock is applied.

If Terraform cannot get the lock, it will stop and not continue.

Although state locking can be disabled using the -lock option, it is not recommended because it can cause serious issues.

(state locking ensures only one Terraform operation can modify the state file at a time, preventing conflicts and corruption.)
